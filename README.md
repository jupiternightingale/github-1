# End Users
The program allows the users to print out any ascii art that they have created. The user can type the name of one of the 
ascii arts that are in the database, into the display window. After they put the name and press enter. Then the picture 
will be in the display window.


#dev
The person need to type in System.out.println
on a new line in the command box. After writing System.out.println, the user has to write parenthesis after it, and also put 
quotes in the parenthesis. After putting the quotes, the user can put what ever they would like. There should also be a semicolon
at the end, to be able to make the command work. If anything is an underline in red, then there is something wrong. There
should be no spaces within the code. Besides, anything within the quotation marks. Another note is that backslashes, should
have two of them inorder for the code to work. Plus, the code will only print with one backslash.
